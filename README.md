# Constructor-Hangman

I had a very difficult time with this one. On a higher level, I had difficulty visualizing how the different documents and constructors would interact. I tried to model this after the "Classroom" assignment with the word.js and letter.js documents, but I got lost in the interaction between the constructors, and I'm not exactly sure where to go.
